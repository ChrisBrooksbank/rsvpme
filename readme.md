#rsvpme

rsvpme allows people to find events that interest them and RSVP to them.

it allows people to easily create their own events and make them discoverable by date, location, name, description and keyword.


A major problem with running events has been getting people to commit and then to actually show up. Lots of people flake out and never actually turn up for events they RSVPd yes to. This frustrates leaders and hosts and often limits the ambition of groups and events.

rsvpme offers Leaders and Hosts the an unparalleded control of their RSVP list. It shows you a clear indication of how likely each yes RSVP will atually attend based on past behaviour. 

rsvpme also allows you to control the minimum reputation of attendees by type of ticket. This gives lots of options for your event admin, e.g. cheaper tickets to people who consistently show up, whch are available earlier.

This also encourages everybody to come to events they have signed up for. If you repeatedly dont show up for events your reputation decreases and it will become more difficult to get on the guest list of the best events.

rsvpme enables you to fire custom events when people rsvp, so that other apps and people can be informed.
