#rsvpme

## Vision
rsvpme allows people to find and join events and tribes that interest them.

A major problem with groups and events has been getting people to commit and then to actually show up. Lots of people flake out and never actually turn up for events they RSVPd yes to. This frustrates leaders and hosts and often limits the ambition of groups and events.

rsvpme offers Leaders and Hosts the an unparalleded control of their RSVP list. It shows you a clear indication of how likely each yes RSVP will atually attend based on past behaviour.

This also encourages everybody to come to events they have signed up for. If you repeatedly dont show up for events your reputation decreases and it will become more difficult to get on the guest list of the best events.

rsvpme enables you to fire custom events when people rsvp, so that other apps and people can be informed.
