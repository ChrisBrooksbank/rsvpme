#rsvpme

## Vision
rsvpme enables leaders to create tribes based on physical location and interests.

rsvpme allows rsvplists to create events and share/promote the event to one or more tribes. Shared RSVP lists.

rsvpme allows people to find and join events and tribes that interest them.

A major problem with groups and events has been getting people to commit and then to actually show up. Lots of people flake out and never actually turn up for events they RSVPd yes to. This frustrates leaders and hosts and often limits the ambition of groups and events.

rsvpme offers Leaders and Hosts the an unparalleded control of their RSVP list. It shows you a clear indication of how likely each yes RSVP will atually attend based on past behaviour.

This also encourages everybody to come to events they have signed up for. If you repeatedly dont show up for events your reputation decreases and it will become more difficult to get on the guest list of the best events.

rsvpme will ensure that people are who they say they are. It wont allow people with bad reputations to simply create multple accounts linked to different email addresses. Rather it will be linked to your facebook account. It will also utilise the facebook social graph to help confirm this is a real person and to add information to the site.

People will also be able to improve their repution by promoting ComeTogether groups and events on facebook or the web.

rsvpme will make more detailed information on behaviours.

Spend reputation points, to say really coming.

It will be trivial for anybody to embed a RSVP link to an event on facebook, twitter, linkedin or their own web page.
